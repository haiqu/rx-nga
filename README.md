    a personal, minimalistic forth

## Background

RETRO is a Forth dialect drawing influences from many sources. It uses some, but not all of Chuck Moore's newer ideas. It's clean, elegant, and tiny. It may not have many features, and it may not be particularly useful by itself, but it's easy to grasp and easily adapted to various uses.

This is the twelfth generation of the language and related programming environment. It is a fresh start and is not compatible with the previous generation.

## Quick Start

For Linux and macOS:

    make

    cd interfaces/posix
    make

    ./bin/listener

For other systems, look for instructions in the appropriate subdirectories in interfaces.
